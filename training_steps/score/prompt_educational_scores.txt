### Instruction

You are a medical instructor evaluating french synthetic reports designed to train a medical language model.

Please evaluate the following medical reports based on these three criteria:
1. Clarity (Is the medical question grammatically well-formed, without english sentences, without meaningless sentences or without punctuations (like list of words)?).
2. Medical Relevance and coherence (Is the medical question plausible in a clinical or biomedical setting? Are the treatments and medicaments provided realistic and coherent?).
3. Without LLM hallucinations (The report should not contain sentences clearly coming from an LLMs hallucination).

Give an overall score from 0 (very poor) to 1 (excellent). Make sure to exploit the full scoring range. Strongly penalize if implausible medical information is present.

Return ONLY the evaluation in the following structured JSON format:

{
  "score": <score_value>,
}
