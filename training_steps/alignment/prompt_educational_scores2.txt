### Instruction

You are a medical instructor evaluating french synthetic reports designed to train a medical language model.

Please evaluate the following medical reports based on these two criteria:
1. Clarity (Is the medical question grammatically well-formed, without english sentences, without meaningless sentences or without punctuations (like list of words)?)
2. Medical Relevance and coherence (Is the medical question plausible in a clinical or biomedical setting? Are the treatments and medicaments provided realistic and coherent?)

Give an overall score from 0 (very poor) to 1 (excellent). Make sure to exploit the full scoring range. Strongly penalize if implausible medical information is present.

Return the evaluation in the following structured JSON format:

{
  "score": <score_value>,
}

Give an explaination for the score.
